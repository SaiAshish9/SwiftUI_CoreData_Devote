```
 @AppStorage("isDarkMode") private var isDarkMode: Bool = false
 @Environment(\.managedObjectContext) private var viewContext
 @State private var task: String = ""
 @Binding var isShowing: Bool
 
```

```
  @AppStorage("isDarkMode") private var isDarkMode: Bool = false
  @State var task: String = ""
  @State private var showNewTaskItem: Bool = false
  @Environment(\.managedObjectContext) private var viewContext
  @FetchRequest(
    sortDescriptors: [NSSortDescriptor(keyPath: \Item.timestamp, ascending: true)],
    animation: .default)
```

```
SwiftUI gives us a dedicated property wrapper for working with Core Data fetch requests, and it allows us to embed data directly into SwiftUI views without having to write extra logic. You must provide @FetchRequest with at least two values: the entity you want to read, and any sort descriptors to arrange the data.
```

```
With @Binding, you can pass the @State variable value from parent view to child view and if child view alters, mutates, or changes the value of @State, the parent will automatically get the updated value and re-render the view. This means you can update the parent view from the child view just by changing the value of the parent viewâ€™s @State variable in the child view using @Binding.
